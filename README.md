# Project_SHIKSHA
This repository contains the code for making the interface using a blockchain dapp, through which the government can transact the money on different government school schemes using the cryptocurrency with the involvement of the public in the decision-making process, making the government more accountable and improving the quality of government school education through public intervention. The backend blockchain is a hosted on Ethereum setup, and the blockchain interactions are made possible using the WEB3 javascript library.

# Why do we need Project_SHIKSHA?

India's education system is considered to be one of the world's largest. As of the 2018 census, approximately 225 million students were enrolled in school. According to the census, the number of enrolled students in government schools was 131 million, and the number of students enrolled in privately managed schools was 119 million. According The government of India's budget allocation for the education sector in 2022 is approximately Rs 1,04,278 crore, which is 3.1% of India's GDP.

SO WHAT'S MAKING THE REAL PROBLEM?

The real problem is the transparency of the government education fund, the quality of the education in the elementary government schools, and the crores of corruption involved in it. Funding for elementary education is limited due to the zero involvement of the public in the decision-making process and the ignorance of government-aided schools. assuming the basic fundamental right RTE (RIGHT TO EDUCATION), which emphasises providing FREE and COMPULSORY education to children ages 6–14 years. But in the practical sense, we are not providing even the most fundamental of rights properly.

The quality of education provided by government schools is very low. Due to this, we can see a drop in the percentage of students enrolling in government schools and an increase in the percentage of students enrolling in privately managed schools, which cost lakhs of rupees and where an average Indian cannot afford to send his son or daughter. Due to the high prices of private schools, many parents in India are taking out large loans and falling into debt. The entire education sector has become a debt trap, and children are paying the price. On the basis of an education survey, government schools spend nearly twice as much as what a private school spends on a single student annually. But the output is completely opposite.

Different reasons for the failure of Government schools are:

1. Lack of transparency in the allocation of funds towards education schemes.

2. Increase in the corruption of Government fund.

3. Lack of public involvement in the decision making process.

4. Creating a false databases and very complex system to get the complete audit of government spendings. 

# How Project_SHIKSHA can help to solve the problem:

PROJECTED SOLUTION FOR NOW:

SHIKSHA is a public blockchain-based transparent interface through which government funds are transacted transparently. Basically, the government changes the actual currency into the cryptocurrency (ethers) and transfer it to the blockchain network, where it is handled by smart contracts. We are also providing an interface through which we are raising the funds from the public, through which any citizen or private company as a part of social work can fund the government's education schemes, which in turn provide the chance for public involvement in the decision-making process. During any transaction of currency towards any scheme, everyone involved in the network gets a chance to authorise the transaction. We follow a 50% percent consensus rule only when more than 50% of the nodes have accepted the transaction can it proceed. Every node Participated in the network can work cooperatively by giving suggestions for the allocation of funds.


PROJECTED DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROJECT FOR FUTURE SCOPE:

In the future, we would like to introduce the use of stable coins instead of volatile crypto currencies, which are susceptible to stock rates. As the Government of India is introducing the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), which has already been introduced in many countries. CBDC can also be introduced in the Project_SHIKSHA once after the government's confirmation of stale coins.

BUT HOW ABOUT THE VALUE OF STABLE COINS MAINTAINED, IF WE SHIFT THE SYSTEM TO STABLE COINS?

The value of the stable coins is directly maintained by the real currency that we hold, which has the same value as the stable coin. So during any crash of
The coin can be easily exchanged for the same value.


HOW CAN WE BENEFIT FROM THE INTERVENTION OF THE PUBLIC IN THE SYSTEM?

India is trying to introduce private or public enterprises into almost all government sectors so that decisions are taken in collaboration, which is indirectly involving the public in the country's development decisions. Improving the education sector also needs public intervention because, in India, every child should be provided with the elementary education FREE and EQUALLY .The quality of education should not be divided on the basis of how much a child's parents can afford. When the public is Involved in this project automatically the government becomes accountable, the fund reaches the school, involving a very simple system that can eliminate corruption,The quality of the infrastructure starts to increase in the government schools, which in turn motivates parents to send their children to government school. Government schools are backbone to the development of country by providing the quality education.

Advantages of this system include:

1. Providing the complete transparent system through which public also has the authorization power.

2. Eliminating the corruption to the maximum extent.

3. Providing less complex system and trnasferring of the funds immediately or through very fast response.

4. False databases cannot be created because every transaction can be viewed in the ether scan and also whole system is on blockchain network which is decentralized.

5. Building confidence in the public on the government system by introducing the latest technology.

SCALABILITY OF Project_SHIKSHA:

Project_SHIKSHA can be scalable by using DD (Develop Deploy)

Develop:
In the development phase it is introduced in a smaller scale and can be tested for its working model and can be developed with the pertaining situations.

Deploy:
In the deploy phase the developed project can be applied on a much larger scale for more developments.

# WORKING MODEL:

The above image is the home page of SHIKSHA, where the information of the project is described and where you can also find information regarding the problem we are trying to solve. We can find a "CONNECT" button at the top right corner, which when clicked directly opens your "METAMASK" interface, through which you can connect your Metamask account and start to fund the government schemes. You can also find two buttons named "DONATE" and "AUTHENTICATE," which are used to direct you to the donate page and the database of the people who have contributed to the scheme, respectively.

The donation page, which may be accessed by any interested public or private organisations, is depicted in the above image. The form includes a public address that includes the public address of the account, and the amount of money in ETH which they are contributing towards the social cause.

EXAMPLE:
An example is illustrated below on how we can enter the details:

The above image depicts the 50% consensus rule that we are applying in any approval of transaction which is combinely taken by government and public

# NOTE:
Due to unavailability of many accounts we could not show you the complete approval but once a request is generated, it is automatically applied from backend. We would try to bring you that very soon in the future developments :).

Above image shows the command lines for easy interpretation.

# ADDING LOCAL DATABASE TO SEE DONATERS LIST:

NOTE: You need to connect to your "MongoDBCompass" to see your list of "DONORS" in the "DONATERS" list.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80589550/200308837-0c2c1df3-014d-4590-b5ac-dab74847a5dd.png)

Your data is stored in this fashion in your local MongoDBCompass

NOTE: Make sure you download the MongoDBCompass and connect it locally before you access the "DONATERS LIST IN THE APP". If not you might run into congestion when you host it locally on your system.
